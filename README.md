# react-dev-week-2-react-app

**Author:** Patrick Nayituriki

This project was created by Patrick Nayituriki as part of a guided learning activity. It demonstrates a simple React app using TypeScript and Vite, with a custom component that displays a large heading, a paragraph, and my name in italicâ€”just like the screenshot output.

## Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/ALU-BSE/week-2-creating-your-first-react-app-Pnayiturik.git
	cd week-2-creating-your-first-react-app-Pnayiturik/my-first-react-app
	```

2. **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```

3. **Start the development server:**
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```

4. **Open your browser and visit:**
	[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

You should see a large heading saying "Hello from MyComponent!", a paragraph of text, and my name in italic displayed on the page.
